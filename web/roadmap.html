        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
          The Rubinius team is now focused on pushing Rubinius into the hands of all developers.
          To that end, the current highlevel roadmap goals for the next major release are:
          <ul>

            <li>Microsoft Windows support</li>
            <li>Ruby 1.9 support</li>
            <li>Full CPU concurrency (hydra)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This roadmap is short on details about these because work on these elements has
          just begun. We'll update the roadmap as we formulate better what our approach is
          going to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feel free to stop by #rubinius for an in-person update.
