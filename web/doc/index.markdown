## Documentation

Rubinius is a complex system with many parts. We attempt to document that
here. This is an on-going process as Rubinius grows and matures. Documentation
may not be up-to-date. We seek your assistance in making this documentation
excellent.


## Languages

The documentation is presented in several languages. Again, we need your help
to translate the documentation and ensure it is accurate. The documentation is
typically written in English originally and later translated to other
languages.
