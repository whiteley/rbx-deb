As a result of the [Rubinius Rewards](http://rubini.us/2011/05/26/rubinius-rewards/ "Announcing Rubinius Rewards - Rubinius"), people from all over the world have requested Rubinius stickers and t-shirts. That just warms our little hearts and humbles us everyday. Thank you so much. It means the world to us. Keep using Rubinius with passion and excitement. Keep spreading the good word to your friends and anyone who'll listen and care. And keep telling us how Rubinius is working for you. However good or bad, we want to know.

Here's a map of all the places where we've sent stickers and/or t-shirts. You can also view it on

Again, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Stay safe, kids.
