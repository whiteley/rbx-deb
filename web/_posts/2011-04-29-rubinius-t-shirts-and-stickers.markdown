### Allow Myself to Introduce Myself

Hi. I'm Shane ([@veganstraightedge](http://twitter.com/veganstraightedge)
/ [iamshane.com](http://iamshane.com)). I'll be helping out around here now.
I was recently hired by [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com) to be their Open
Source Cheerleader. (Yes, there will be costumes at some point.) My
primary focus is **Rubinius! Rubinius! Rubinius!**

I have lots of big plans for helping get Rubinius used by more people
in more places and how to have a better conversation with people who are using
it. For now though, I tell you about just the first thing that I've done.

### T-Shirts

#### The First Ever Rubinius T-Shirt from RailsConf 2007

A long time ago (2007) in a city far, far away (Seattle, WA), Evan and I made
the first batch of Rubinius t-shirts. There were about two dozen made and
given to the handful of contributors at the time. This was at RailsConf in
Portland, OR. Since then there hasn't been *anything* made with the Rubinius
logo on it.

Now is the time to rectify that. We've made two different t-shirts. Same
messaging, slightly different design orientation. Both are the same colors:
white on asphalt. They are available in an assortment of sizes from women's
small to unisex xx-large.

#### Use Ruby™ Rubinius T-Shirts from RailsConf 2011

If you're going to RailsConf 2011 in Baltimore, MD, stop by the Engine Yard booth
to pick up a free Rubinius t-shirt. After RailsConf we'll have ways to get one
from us directly.


### Stickers

To go along with the t-shirts, we're making a whole grip of Rubinius stickers.
Most of which will also be available for free from the Engine Yard booth at
RailsConf in Baltimore. Again, after RailsConf you'll be able to get them
directly from us. More on that later. Here's what we have in store.

#### Wide Screen (7in x 3.75in)

#### I'm Committed Merit Sticker

This one you have to earn. At the end of each quarter, we'll send out a little
one inch square sticker with a year/quarter combination in its corner to
everyone who committed something to Rubinius during that calendar quarter. For
all of the incredible folks who've contributed something (however big or small)
already, you'll get a special sticker. Instead of a date, there's an asterisk.
Only those of you that've committed so far will get that one.
