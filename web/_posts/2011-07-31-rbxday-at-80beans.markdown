title: Come hack in Amsterdam for &#35;rbxday
author: Dirkjan Bussink

Not only in the US is [&#35;rbxday](http://rbxday.rubini.us/) celebrated, but
we have also something in Amsterdam next Friday. It's really becoming the
International Rubinius Day that it was set out to be.

The guys are [80beans](http://www.80beans.com/) are sponsoring the event and
have graciously offered their office as the place to hang out and are
providing refreshments. The office is located on the [Vijzelstraat 72](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=80beans,+Amsterdam,+The+Netherlands&hl=en&cid=15251096961071716406) in
Amsterdam and we're starting at 3pm.

If you're living in the neighborhood, please come and join us. As long
term Rubinius contributor Dirkjan Bussink is coming over from the other side of
the country, so don't feel held back when you're not living in Amsterdam
itself.

So be prepared for an afternoon of very interesting hacking. We really want
to make it a fun afternoon of experimenting with Rubinius, so anything
goes! Please leave a message on the [80beans blog](http://www.80beans.com/en/blog) if you're planning to come over:

Hopefully see you there!
