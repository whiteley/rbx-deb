I&rsquo;m pretty sure it started like this.

> &ldquo;Hello, Evan dear.&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty*

> &ldquo;Grandma Betty!&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan*

> &ldquo;You know, I was thinking about your little Rubinius thingy while I was gardening today. How&rsquo;s it doing?&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty*

> &ldquo;Oh, Grandma Betty, that&rsquo;s so sweet of you to think of me and it. It&rsquo;s coming along still, of course.&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan*

> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear. I was specifically wondering how the 1.9 support is looking.&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty*

> &ldquo;Grandma Betty! You do always love the Latest and Greatest&trade;, don&rsquo;t you? Well, let&rsquo;s see. I&rsquo;d say that *1.9 support* comes down to 7 main areas: Encoding, String, Regex, Symbol, IO, Argument Processing, Windows Support. Each has varying degrees of progress.&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan*

> &ldquo;OK. I wish that there was some way for me to keep more up to date on these happenings without needing to calling you. When I call you, I want to hear about that wife and baby of yours.&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty*

> &ldquo;You got it, Grandma Betty. I&rsquo;ll get my Top Nerds&trade; on the case.&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan*

> [sometime later]

> &ldquo;Alright, Grandma Betty. We made the Rubinius Status Board&trade; especially just for you. It&rsquo;s [status.rubini.us](http://status.rubini.us)&rdquo; &mdash; *Evan*

That conversation may or may not be **completely fictionalized**. There is one thing that is most emphatically true: Rubinius has a Status Board&trade; now. If you are ever curious how progress is going on things, go check out [status.rubini.us](http://status.rubini.us). Tell your friends.

XOXO RBX.
