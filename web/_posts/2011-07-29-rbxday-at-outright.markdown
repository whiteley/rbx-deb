Hey Ruby bytecode fans! The first ever **International Rubinius Day** is next
Friday, August 5th. Around the world people will be trying their code on
Rubinius and generally having a fun time. Follow the activities on Twitter
under the _\#rbxday_ tag and use that to let folks know what you're up to. Stay
tuned to the [rbxday website](http://rbxday.rubini.us/) for details as the day
unfolds.

If you are located in, around, or within traveling distance of beautiful
Mountain View, CA, the terrific folks at [Outright.com](http://outright.com)
are sponsoring a real live _\#rbxday_ event! Come hang out with a bunch of
hardcore Ruby nerds, including Brian Ford (that's me) from the Rubinius team.
Plan to be inspired by all the great stuff people are working on. There will
be mountains of top-shelf Rubinius schwag, as well as _free beer and pizza_.
(Just don't get too trashed as there will also be lightning talks and an IR
helicopter obstacle course.)

The [party](http://rbxday.eventbrite.com/) will be from 1:00 pm to 8:00 pm on
Friday August 5th at Outright's offices in downtown Mountain View. (They have
an application that does some seriously awesome stuff with small business
accounting.) There are plenty of desks, monitors and whiteboards available, so
bring your laptop and be ready to jam.

Space is limited, and the coolest developers in the valley are already coming,
so if you know your stuff and want to have fun, [rsvp
now](http://rbxday.eventbrite.com/)!

See you there!
