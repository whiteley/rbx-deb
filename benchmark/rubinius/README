Rubinius Benchmarks
-------------------

These benchmarks have all been written as a part of the Rubinius project.
There are three categories of files in this directory: any that start with
`bm_*` should contain only the code to be run as a part of the benchmark.
The benchmarking itself is handled by `bin/bm` for those files (and they
are automatically run as a part of that invocation.) Any that start with
`standalone_*` are, somewhat obviously, standalone scripts and usually
combine some of the smaller scripts into entities. Broadly, any benchmark
that exists in a standalone should also have a `bm_*` file. Thirdly, any
files that have neither specifier are usually helpers etc.


Specific Benchmark Details
