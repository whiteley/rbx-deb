rb_MatrixBenchmark.rb was pulled into the Rubinius repository from:

  svn checkout http://cougar.rubyforge.org/svn/

It lives in this RubyForge project:

  http://rubyforge.org/projects/cougar/

It's licensing information can be found in the README file located
in the same directory as this file.

The name of the file was changed to work as part of the Rubinius
benchmarking system. The file was also slightly modified to allow
the require of hilbert.rb to succeed under this same system.
